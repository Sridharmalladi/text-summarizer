# 🚀 ArXiv Metadata Summarization Project
Welcome to the ArXiv Metadata Summarization Project! This project is designed to help you process and summarize research paper metadata from the ArXiv dataset using cutting-edge NLP models. We’ll be leveraging Hugging Face's BART model to generate concise summaries of research paper abstracts.

📝 Project Overview
In this project, you will:

Load and process metadata from ArXiv’s snapshot JSON dataset.
Extract information like id, submitter, authors, title, abstract, and more.
Use Hugging Face's pre-trained BART model to summarize the paper abstracts.
Save the summarized data for future analysis or use.
📂 Dataset
The dataset is a large JSON file named arxiv-metadata-oai-snapshot.json which contains metadata for research papers. Each entry includes:

id: The unique identifier for the paper.
submitter: The individual who submitted the paper.
authors: List of authors who contributed to the paper.
title: The title of the research paper.
abstract: A brief summary of the research paper.
categories: The subject category (e.g., hep-ph, math.CO).
doi and journal-ref: Information about publication.
⚙️ Requirements
To get started, ensure you have the following installed:

bash
Copy code
pip install transformers pandas ijson
You will also need a Hugging Face access token to authenticate the use of their models. You can create an access token from your Hugging Face account.

🚀 Steps to Run the Project
1. Authenticate with Hugging Face 🤖
You’ll need to authenticate Hugging Face in your environment with your access token.

python
Copy code
from huggingface_hub import login

# Log in using your access token
login("your_hugging_face_access_token")
2. Load and Process the Dataset 📂
We’re working with a large JSON file containing ArXiv metadata. Here’s how you can load it and extract key fields.

python
Copy code
import pandas as pd
import json

# Function to load JSON objects from file
def load_json_objects(filename):
    with open(filename, 'r') as f:
        for line in f:
            try:
                yield json.loads(line)
            except json.JSONDecodeError as e:
                print(f"Skipping invalid JSON object: {e}")

# Define the path to the dataset
file_path = '/content/drive/My Drive/Colab Notebooks/arxiv-metadata-oai-snapshot.json'

# Extract relevant fields from the dataset
extracted_data = []
for item in load_json_objects(file_path):
    paper_data = {
        'id': item.get('id'),
        'submitter': item.get('submitter'),
        'authors': item.get('authors'),
        'title': item.get('title'),
        'abstract': item.get('abstract'),
        'categories': item.get('categories'),
        'doi': item.get('doi'),
        'journal_ref': item.get('journal-ref')
    }
    extracted_data.append(paper_data)

# Convert the extracted data into a DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame(extracted_data)
print(df.head())
3. Summarize the Abstracts ✍️
Now that the data is loaded, we’ll use Hugging Face’s BART model to generate summaries for the abstracts.

python
Copy code
from transformers import pipeline

# Load the pre-trained BART model for summarization
summarizer = pipeline('summarization', model="facebook/bart-large-cnn")

# Summarize the first 5 abstracts
for i, abstract in enumerate(df['abstract'].dropna().head(5)):
    print(f"Abstract {i+1} Summary:")
    summary = summarizer(abstract, max_length=100, min_length=30, do_sample=False)
    print(summary[0]['summary_text'])
    print("\n")
4. Save the Summarized Data 💾
Once you’ve generated the summaries, you can store them back into the DataFrame and save the results for future use.

python
Copy code
# Create a new column for storing the summaries
df['summary'] = df['abstract'].dropna().apply(lambda abstract: summarizer(abstract, max_length=100, min_length=30, do_sample=False)[0]['summary_text'])

# Save the DataFrame to a CSV file
df.to_csv('/content/drive/My Drive/Colab Notebooks/arxiv_summarized_data.csv', index=False)
